                        was made to start with the medium - high fidelity prototyping and give that activity 
                        all the time possible. This way, the users could test on a prototype that was 
                        closer to reality.

                <p>This project was a great learning experience for me as I was required to 
                    perform intense research while interpreting and organizing data in different 
                    ways in order to meet with users expectations. As I finished by high fidelity 
                    prototypes and conducted usability user testing, I learned to prioritize different 
                    requests in order of importance since the window to implement those requests was very short.<br>
                    <br>
                    There are endless opportunities to iterate and make our projects better. The difficult thing 
                    is to let them go when it is time to do so. Our desire in trying to reach the “perfect” project 
                    has to be controlled and let way to a sense of contentment that providing a very good solution brings. 
                    We need to understand that a project can always be improved.
